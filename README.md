### Design Thinking
- how to design kanban
- most of the kanban design can drag the interface into more design panel. Actually, it is not suitable for the operation in the desktop. How can we solve this problem but also satisfied user need.
- 固定宽度比较好
- search for existing for each panel
- when user browse into some item, it can enlarge
- how the information architecture in each item
- how to organize the item together
- add 可以指定加入某个条目
- 这个一定是瀑布设计，考虑到以后的扩展性
